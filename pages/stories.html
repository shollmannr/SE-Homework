<p>Greetings all! I am attending from the Cincinnati campus. I grew up in Milford, Ohio. That is where I attended all of my school from preschool through high school. I then attended the University of Cincinnati straight out of high school. I quickly figured out that criminal justice wasn't for me and only completed my core classes. Many years later, ended up here with all of you. I was actually referred by a Per Scholas graduate.</p>

<p>I have a love for the outdoors and animals. I love the beauty of nature, it can be so relaxing. In my down time I enjoy researching mobile neworks and reading up on all of the tests performed nationwide. I also enjoy watching sports, especially during these times even more than usual. With the finals and Olympics(exhibition) happening.<p>
